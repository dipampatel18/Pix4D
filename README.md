# Pix4D
Creating a 3D Model and Map of University of Maryland using Pix4D

How Pix4D Works-
### Bundle Block Adjustment (BBA)
- Camera's Position - External Camera (EO) and Internal Camera (IO) parameters are calculated
- Determine the camera orientation based on the angles and perspectives
- Points and perspective-angle calculate reconstruction imagery

### Automatic Aerial Triangulation (AAT)
- Detection of prominent points from multiple directions
- Wide overlapping aerial images
- Calculate relative positions - Nodes and Camera

### Photogrammetry
- Measurement and Evaluation Methods of Remote Sensing
- Determine the spatial position
- Determine three-dimensional shape of objects
- Use photographs and accurate measurement images
- Mapped display of data based on photos and positions
